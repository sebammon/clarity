# Clarity

Gain clarity on open MRs. This app gives you a simple overview on for the latest activity on MRs you are reviewing or
assigned to.

## Features

* Latest (user) activity
* MR status

## Usage

Follow the steps below to get started using clarity:

1. Create
   [personal access](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token)
   token with `read_api` scope to authenticate yourself against the API (set the expiry date for a reasonable time in
   the future)

## TODO

* Generalise API base url
* Pipeline status and overall status
* CTRL-Z undo marked read
* Notifications for changes in MR status (this can be merged now)
